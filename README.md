# Debian updater
A simple .bash file to upate your Debian system using apt and flatpak.

This is a simple update program that uses apt(-get) and flatpak to update your system. It uses collor to make clear what is going to happen next.

Updates to turn off updating from other sources and turning them off without edditing the code wil follow soon.
